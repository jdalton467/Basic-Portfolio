			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Hello there! My name is James Dalton and I an aspiring webdeveloper. One of
			my main interests is mobile development. Someday, I would like to be able to create 
			a game that is enjoyable for everyone. As for my career aspirations, I would prefer to 
			go into free-lance work, or even more ideal, create my own tech start-up. It will be 
			a long road, but it will definitely be worth it in the end.</p>

			</p>Some of my hobbies include running, listening to live music, and playing(or at least trying)
			to play live music.
