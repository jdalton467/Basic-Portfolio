			<p class="about">Hello there! My name is James Dalton and I an aspiring webdeveloper. One of
			my main interests is mobile development. Someday, I would like to be able to create 
			a game that is enjoyable for everyone. As for my career aspirations, I would prefer to 
			go into free-lance work, or even more ideal, create my own tech start-up. It will be 
			a long road, but it will definitely be worth it in the end.</p>

			<p class ="about">I came to Rutger's Coding Bootcamp because I wanted a chance to increase my skill set for the workforce, be challenged, and have fun while doing it! I plan to put a lot of work into this, and I hope I get a lot out of it.</p>

			<p class="about">Some of my hobbies include running, listening to live music, and playing(or at least trying)to play live music.</p>
